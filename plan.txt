Here’s a **plain-English, build-focused summary** of what the **Claude Agent SDK** actually does, framed for your FixMate-style system.

---

## **What the Claude Agent SDK Does (In Practice)**

The Claude Agent SDK lets you build **long-running, stateful AI agents** that can **reason, plan, take actions, observe results, and continue working** over time — instead of just answering one prompt and stopping.

Think of it as the difference between:

* ❌ a chatbot that replies once
* ✅ a **digital worker** that manages a workflow

---

## **Core Capabilities (Mapped to Your Use Case)**

### **1. Persistent AI Agents**

Claude agents:

* Maintain memory across steps
* Track task state (e.g. *follow-up pending*, *awaiting photo*, *verified*)
* Resume work after delays (hours / days)

👉 In FixMate terms:

> One agent “owns” an issue from resolution → follow-ups → verification → closure.

---

### **2. Tool Use (Action, Not Just Text)**

Agents can:

* Call APIs
* Schedule jobs
* Write to databases
* Trigger workflows
* Fetch data
* Update dashboards

👉 Example actions:

* Schedule a Day-7 pest follow-up
* Store compliance score
* Trigger landlord alert
* Request photo re-submission
* Escalate to tradesman callback

---

### **3. Multi-Step Reasoning**

Agents can:

* Break tasks into steps
* Evaluate outcomes
* Branch logic based on results
* Decide *what to do next*

👉 Example:

```
Photo received →
Analyze hygiene →
Score compliance →
If <50% →
  escalate + education
Else →
  schedule next check
```

This is **built-in agent logic**, not prompt hacks.

---

### **4. Event-Driven Workflows**

Agents can be triggered by:

* Time (cron / delay)
* User responses
* External events (API callbacks)
* Data changes

👉 Perfect for:

* Follow-up matrices
* Delayed verification
* Multi-stage checks (Day 7 / Day 14 / Day 30)

---

### **5. Memory & State Management**

The SDK supports:

* Structured memory (JSON state)
* Short-term reasoning memory
* Long-term task context

👉 Enables:

* Compliance history per student
* Issue timelines
* Escalation history
* Predictive risk inputs

---

### **6. Safe Autonomy (Guardrails)**

You define:

* What tools the agent can use
* What it cannot do
* Approval boundaries
* Escalation thresholds

👉 Critical for:

* Legal defensibility
* No accidental charging
* No aggressive messaging
* Evidence-first alerts

---

## **What It Is NOT**

Claude Agent SDK is **not**:

* A UI framework
* A chatbot builder
* A workflow SaaS
* A replacement for your backend

It is:

> **The AI brain that runs inside your system**

---

## **Why It’s a Good Fit for FixMate**

Because FixMate is:

* Long-running
* State-based
* Evidence-driven
* Multi-stage
* Outcome-dependent

Claude agents are designed exactly for:

* “Check again later”
* “Wait for evidence”
* “Decide based on results”
* “Escalate only if needed”

---

## **One-Sentence Summary**

> **The Claude Agent SDK lets you build AI agents that manage real workflows over time — observing, deciding, acting, and learning — instead of just replying to messages.**

If you want next, I can:

* Map **one FixMate issue** (e.g. mould) to a **Claude agent lifecycle**
* Show **what runs in Claude vs your backend**
* Design the **agent state schema**
* Compare Claude Agent SDK vs LangGraph / Temporal / n8n for this job
